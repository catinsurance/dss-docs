## What is this?

Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) is a mod library that can be used to add a customizable menu to your Isaac mod. It is highly configurable and is used by mods such as [Fiend Folio: Reheated](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2851063440) and [Epiphany](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2635111236).

DSS is mod-independent and doesn't require the developer to change anything within its core code.
